##Introduction
I grabbed a library that would make it pretty easy to move through the DOM (phpquery).  And started to try to 
walk through the html.  So basically, this was done pretty quickly, since I only had a few hours to try to look at the doom,
and see the differences.  Hopefully I will have more time in the future to do a better job.
